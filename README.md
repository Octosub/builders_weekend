# Builders Weekend - Hackathon Project
## A program which creates a video trailer out of still images and is targeted at users of the Rebase platform to advertise the rooms they're renting.

This program was built within 3 days for the Builders Weekend Hackathon in Tokyo.

The idea was to concatatenate the MP4's with (ffmpeg)[https://ffmpeg.org/] and make a trailer that could've looked something like this.

But we ran out of time before being able to concatenate the videos together.
